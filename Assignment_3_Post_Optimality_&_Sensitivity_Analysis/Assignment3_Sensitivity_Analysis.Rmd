## Introduction



## Solve the LP Model

In this assignment, we chose to write the problem formulation in the lp format, a text file created specifically for this problem, that includes all the information. 

```{r}
x <- read.lp("Weigelt_Corporation_Assignment3.lp")
x
```


```{r}
solve(x)
```

```{r}
get.objective(x)
get.variables(x)
```

```{r}
get.constraints(x)
```

```{r}
get.sensitivity.rhs(x) #shadow prices
get.sensitivity.obj(x) #reduced costs
```
